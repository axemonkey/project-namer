project-namer
=============
The company I was working for had a habit of giving super-sekrit codenames to projects. I was just commenting to a cow-orker about projects LaserWolf and SlimePig when I was made aware of the new project ThunderPony. I decided I should build a tool to help them with this process.

NOTE
----
I was aware of the very similar site http://codenames.sergiogarcez.com/ at the time, but I found some of the options there a bit clumsy and clunky, so wanted to make my own. I have not ripped off any of the code from that site, just the idea.
